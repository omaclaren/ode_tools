# ode_tools
Some simple tools to help make building and solving ODE models in Python a little easier. Still uses standard Python solvers. 
Focus is on allowing separate 'stoichiometric' specifications for mass balance and 'constitutive' equations for fluxes. 

Very rough code. Public mainly just in case I want to use for teaching.

Requires scipy, numpy, graphviz (for visualisation of model structure). Examples use matplotlib as well.
